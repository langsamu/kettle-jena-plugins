This project contains plugins for [Pentaho Data Integration](https://github.com/pentaho/pentaho-kettle) (or KETTLE as it is commonly known),
that add functionality via [Apache Jena](https://jena.apache.org/) for producing RDF.

The plugins provided are:
1. Create Jena Model
    
    This transform plugin can be used to create a Jena Model for each row sent to it. The plugin enables the mapping of database columns to RDF Literals or Resources.

2. Serialize Jena Model
    
    This output plugin takes the output of the Create Jena Model plugin, and serializes it to an RDF file on disk. Supports Turtle, N3, N-Triples, and RDF/XML output formats.

This project was developed by [Evolved Binary](https://evolvedbinary.com) as part of Project OMEGA for the [National Archives](https://nationalarchives.gov.uk).

## Getting the Plugins

You can either download the plugins from our GitHub releases page: https://github.com/nationalarchives/kettle-jena-plugins/releases/, or you can build them from source.

## Building from Source Code
The plugins can be built from Source code by installing the pre-requisites and following the steps described below.

### Pre-requisites for building the project:
* [Apache Maven](https://maven.apache.org/), version 3+
* [Java JDK](https://adoptopenjdk.net/) 1.8
* [Git](https://git-scm.com)

### Build steps:
1. Clone the Git repository
    ```
    $ git clone https://github.com/nationalarchives/kettle-jena-plugins.git
    ```

2. Compile a package
    ```
    $ cd kettle-jena-plugins
    $ mvn clean package
    ```
    
3. The plugins directory is then available at `target/kettle-jena-plugins-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT-kettle-plugin/kettle-jena-plugins`


## Installing the plugins
* Tested with Pentaho Data Integration - Community Edition - version: 8.3.0.0-371

You can simply copy the plugins directory `kettle-jena-plugins` (from building above) into the `plugins` sub-directory of your KETTLE installation, e.g.:
```
  $ cp -r target/kettle-jena-plugins-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT-kettle-plugin/kettle-jena-plugins /opt/data-integration/plugins/
```

## Using the plugins
We wrote a short blog about working with the plugins: https://blog.adamretter.org.uk/rdf-plugins-for-pentaho-kettle/

We also created a small screencast demonstrating how to use the plugins in Pentaho Kettle. It's hosted on YouTube, click the image below to visit the video:
